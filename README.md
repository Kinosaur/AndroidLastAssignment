# Android Assignment

## Instructions

Create an Android application that displays a list of people retrieved from the provided API. Each list item includes swipeable options for the following actions:

- **Save** → When clicked, the image of that person will be stored in persistent storage. The image should remain available even after the application is relaunched.
- **Delete** → When clicked, the person will be removed from the list.

## Features

1. **Load Person** → Fetches a person's information from the API and displays it in the list.
2. **View Gallery** → Opens a new screen displaying a list of saved images. When an image is clicked, it should be displayed in full-screen mode on another screen.

## Additional Requirements
